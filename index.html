<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Hello! test My name is Lauren. I am a junior at Lewis University and am studying English with a concentration in general writing. I play the violin in my school's orchestra- MYSO- and the bass guitar in the jazz band.
I currently work at Lewis' Writing Center, and I love it! <br><br> I live in Lockport with my parents, and we are frequently visited by my sister and her new baby Estelle. Estelle is the cutest thing to ever exist, as evident
in the following picture:</p>

<h2>What I Hope to Learn in this Course</h2>
<ul>
	<li>how to use CSS to make cool-looking/user-friendly HTML cites</li>
	<li>the differences between Powershell and Visual Studio; and how to make use of them</li>
	<li>a basic understanding of my computer and how it does what it does</li>
</ul>

<h2>My Favorite Hobby/Activity</h2>
<p>My favorite thing to do right now is crochet! I learned through books and YouTube videos a few years ago, and after taking a while off, I recently took up the craft again. I've made <b>lots</b> of stuffed animals, a scarf, a few hats, a baby blanket,
and am currently working on a sweater.
<br><br>
I also like to play video games. I actually just got the PS5, and it is so cool! Right now, I am playing <i>Sable</i>, but some of my favorite games are the <i>Horizon</i> series, <i>God of War: Ragnorok</i>, <i>Fallout 4</i>, and <i>The Last of Us Part Two</i>.</p>

<h2>Fun Fact</h2>
<p>I have a ton of pets! I used to work at PetSmart, so that is how I got most of them. I have a bearded dragon, a tortoise, a betta fish, two guinea pigs, two parakeets, two zebra finches, and a big 75 gallon tank with a handful of fish.</p>

<h2>Greatest Innovation</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/6/16/18076282/the-internet">The internet</a> is incredibly powerful and provides us access to a near infinite cache of information. It's so important to our societ that I can't imagine
technology separte from it.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.scienceabc.com/innovation/how-did-computers-go-from-the-size-of-a-room-to-the-size-of-a-fingernail.html">The shrinking size of transistors</a> allowed computers to go from being the size of the room to being hand-held devices. This helped them to become more wide
spread.</li>
	<li>Though not the most exciting invention, <a href="https://history-computer.com/abacus/#:~:text=While%20not%20technically%20a%20computer,to%20Charles%20Babbage%20in%201822.">the abacus</a> is the earliest calculator and led to the invention of the computer.
